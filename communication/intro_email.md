Dear Stuart,

Our team, the Georgetown University Capstone Project group, is assisting the World Bankâ€™s West and Central Africa Institutions Unit on the Decentralization Transfer Project. We are eager to start working on this project. Attached are brief bios for each team member.

We would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss the project and your expectations. If feasible, we prefer an in-person meeting at the World Bank or hosted at Georgetown University.

Please suggest a time during the week of [insert date], as [insert best days, e.g., Monday through Wednesday] work best for our group. We look forward to your response and are excited to contribute to this project.

Sincerely,
Georgetown Capstone Team
Ethan, Martin, Daniela, and Uendjii
