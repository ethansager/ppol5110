# Raw Data Directory

## Data Loading Instructions

The raw data files for this project should be loaded locally by each user from the shared OneDrive folder provided by Stuart.

### Steps to set up data:

1. Access the shared OneDrive folder for this project
2. Download the raw data files to this `raw_data/` directory
3. Ensure all data files are placed directly in this folder
4. Do not commit raw data files to the repository (they are ignored by .gitignore)

### Important Notes:

- Raw data files are not stored in this repository due to size and privacy considerations
- Each team member needs to download the data locally before running analysis scripts
- Contact Ethan if you need access to the OneDrive folder
- Maintain the original file names when downloading to ensure scripts work correctly
